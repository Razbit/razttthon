razttthon
=========

Razbit's Python -implemented object-oriented Tic Tac Toe -game

This is the final project of the programming course I am attending, have fun with the game!

How to use:
Windows: extract binaries/razttthon-win32.zip whereever you want and run razttthon.exe from the created directory .
*nix: in a terminal run chmod +x start.sh and then run  ./start.sh. Make sure to have Python 2.7 installed (most Linux distros have it out-of-the-box).

Pretty much everything is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPLv3 license, some borrowed code might differ so make sure to read the copyright notice in each source file.
